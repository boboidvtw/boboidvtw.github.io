## Introduction

Super Calculator is a browser-based calculator and math visualization tool built with **pure HTML + JavaScript** — **single file, zero dependencies, ready to use**. Beyond basic and scientific calculation, it integrates a complete formula library, interactive function plotting, calculus tools, statistics charts, and a custom-built 3D surface plotting engine.

### Design Philosophy

- 🎯 **Zero dependencies**: Single HTML file, no installation, no internet — just double-click
- 📚 **Education-first**: Visualize complex math concepts (derivatives, integrals, regression, 3D surfaces)
- 🌐 **Fully offline**: All computation and rendering happen locally on Canvas
- 🔒 **Security-conscious**: User input is XSS-protected and expressions run in isolated scope
- 🌏 **Cross-platform**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers
- 🌍 **Multilingual**: Full i18n for Traditional Chinese, English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese

## What's New in v3.6 ♿ (Accessibility Hardening)

v3.6.0 (2026-05-22) is the outcome of a WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility deep-audit, closing keyboard-operability and screen-reader gaps present since the project launched. **Every fix was verified item-by-item in a local browser — zero regressions, zero console errors**:

- **Keyboard focus indicator** (WCAG 2.4.7): added a global `:focus-visible` style so every button, tab, and input shows a clear cyan outline under keyboard navigation. Previously there was no focus indication anywhere — keyboard users could not tell where they were.
- **Help accordion now keyboard-operable** (WCAG 2.1.1, Level A): the 6 help-section headers were mouse-only `<div>`s with a `click`-only handler — keyboard users could not expand them. They now carry `role=button`, `tabindex`, `aria-expanded`, and respond to Enter / Space.
- **Modal dialog semantics + focus management**: the 3 modals (Help / Formula / Function Graph) gained `role=dialog`, `aria-modal`, and `aria-labelledby`; added focus-move-in, a focus trap (Tab cycles inside), Escape-to-close, and focus restoration to the trigger button on close.
- **Heading hierarchy fix** (WCAG 1.3.1): the page title is now an `<h1>` and the sidebar headings were reorganized to `h2`/`h3` so the document outline no longer skips levels.
- **Screen-reader announcements**: the result display and toast notifications gained `aria-live`, so computed results and messages are announced.
- **Accessible names**: icon-only buttons such as the theme toggle gained `aria-label`; all 7 `<select>` elements and several placeholder-only inputs were labeled.
- **Mobile touch targets**: function-graph toolbar buttons were raised to the 44px touch standard on mobile; an undefined CSS variable was also fixed.

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## What's New in v3.5 🧮 (Calculation Core Fixes + Angle Mode)

v3.5 (2026-05-19) is the outcome of a full usability review. **Every fix was verified function-by-function in the browser — zero regressions, zero console errors**:

- **Fixed the `%` operator** (CRITICAL): previously any expression containing `%` (`50%`, `100+5%`) returned `Error`. Now uses standard calculator semantics: `50%`→0.5, `100+5%`→105, `200×10%`→20.
- **Fixed function keys in the initial state** (HIGH): pressing `sin( log( √(` while the display showed `0` produced an instant `Error`. Now they work; also fixed a hidden `√` double-substitution bug exposed by this fix.
- **Added DEG / RAD angle-mode toggle** (defaults to DEG): new toolbar button, persisted in `localStorage`. `sin(90)`=1 matches what most users expect; radian mode also supported.
- **Fixed blank unit-conversion result box** (MEDIUM): results ≥ 1000 were cleared due to a thousands-separator vs `type=number` conflict. Two-way conversion, category switching, and special temperature conversion all work now.
- **`sw.js` cache bump**: the Service Worker is cache-first; `CACHE_NAME` was bumped so existing users receive the fixes immediately.

**v3.5.1 (2026-05-20) follow-up fixes** — review continued into programmer / engineering / scientific modes:

- **Engineering `mod` key broken** (v3.5.0 regression): the percentage pre-processing mis-rewrote the `%` emitted by `mod`; now handled separately — `7 mod 3`=1, percentages unaffected.
- **Programmer HEX missing `C` key**: the hex `C` digit was absent from the keypad; restored — `C0`→DEC 192.
- **`nCr(n,r)` / `nPr(n,r)` uninputtable**: no comma key existed anywhere; added `,` to the sidebar common-keys group — `nCr(5,2)`=10 works.

**v3.5.2 (2026-05-20) mobile responsive Bug C fix**:

- **Mobile `( ) , π e` keys unreachable** (HIGH): at ≤768px the entire sidebar was `display:none`, making every function that needs a closing paren (`sin(`, `cos(`, `log(`, `exp(`, …) unusable on mobile. Fix strategy — zero DOM changes, pure CSS responsive rearrangement: at ≤768px the sidebar becomes a bottom-fixed floating bar (industry-standard mobile keyboard pattern), keeping only the 5 critical keys (π e ( ) ,) in a horizontal 5-column grid with `min-height: 44px` touch targets, translucent backdrop adapting to light/dark themes, and iPhone safe-area support. Desktop 1280 verified with zero regression.

**v3.5.9 (2026-05-22) formula library breaks 100 + combinatorics overflow & trig floating-point residue fixed**: two long-standing calculate-engine flaws fixed. (1) **`nCr` / `nPr` large-number overflow** — computed as `factorial(n)/(factorial(r)*factorial(n-r))`, but `factorial(171)` is already `Infinity`, so `nCr(171,2)` returned `Infinity` and `nCr(1000,500)` returned `NaN`, both surfacing as `Error`; rewritten with a multiplicative formula that accumulates term-by-term and uses symmetry `r=min(r,n-r)` to cut iterations — `nCr(171,2)=14535`, `nCr(1000,500)≈2.70e+299`, `nPr(100,3)=970200`. (2) **Trig special-angle floating-point residue** — in DEG mode `sin(180°)` returned `1.22e-16`, `cos(90°)` returned `6.12e-17`; now snapped exactly at the trig-function layer for integer special angles only (deliberately not a result-layer threshold-snap, since legitimate scientific constants like Planck's `6.626e-34` are smaller than the residue and would be killed too) — `sin(180°)=0`, `cos(90°)=0`, `tan(180°)=0`, regression `sin(30°)=0.5` clean. The same release expands the formula library by 12 to the **100-formula milestone**: Science +3 (radioactive half-life, wavelength from frequency, ideal-gas volume), Physics +4 (pressure, power, buoyancy, mass-energy equivalence E=mc²), Math +2 (sphere surface area, exponential growth), Engineering +1 (voltage divider), Finance +2 (gross margin, dividend yield); the gas constant in the ideal-gas (pressure) formula was also made exact at `8.314462618`. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**v3.5.8 (2026-05-21) comprehensive click testing: 2 bugs fixed + physical constants made exact**: a full click-test pass across all 5 tabs + the header (~90 cases) surfaced 2 real bugs, both fixed in one go. (1) **The `|x|` absolute-value key always returned `Error`** — `calculate()` replaced every `|` with `Math.abs(` without the matching `)`; fixed with a paired transform `/\|([^|]*)\|/g`, verified `|3−9|`=6, `2×|3−8|`=10. (2) **CSV export crashed silently on numeric results** — `row.result.replace()` threw a `TypeError` on Number-typed results (~89% of all results are numeric); fixed with `String(row.result)`. The physics constants were also upgraded from 4-significant-figure approximations to **exact CODATA / SI 2019 values**: speed of light 299792458, Planck 6.62607015×10⁻³⁴, Boltzmann 1.380649×10⁻²³, gravitational constant 6.6743×10⁻¹¹, Avogadro 6.02214076×10²³, gas constant 8.314462618, electron charge 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹; the 3 constants embedded in formulas were synced, and exponential trailing-zeros cleaned up. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**v3.5.7 (2026-05-21) formula data consistency audit: naming fix + stale-docs cleanup**: a consistency audit across the formula library and public docs. Fixed a mislabeled formula — id 93 `(220-a)*intensity/100` was named "Karvonen" but is actually the **Percentage of Max HR** method (%MaxHR); the true Karvonen formula needs a resting-heart-rate variable. The formula itself is a valid, widely-used estimator — only the name was wrong, now renamed `Target HR (%MaxHR)`. Also cleared multiple stale claims: index.html guide text "83 formulas / 47 formulas / five categories" all corrected to "88 / six categories"; the README category-overview table (EN & ZH) listed "Geometry / Physics / Chemistry / Finance" which never matched the live app, now rebuilt to the real 6 categories; `docs/FORMULAS.md`, untouched since v1.0.0, rebuilt as a complete 88-formula reference. **No calculate-engine logic changes.**

**v3.5.6 (2026-05-20) calculate engine boundary audit + Health group +5 formulas**: following v3.5.5's two engine bug fixes, this release runs a 12-case numerical boundary audit (large integers, floating-point error, divide-by-zero, log/sqrt edges, factorial, toFixed, constants, scientific notation) — the engine comes out clean. Also expands Health from 4 → **9 formulas** by adding TDEE (M/F), Body Fat % via Deurenberg (M/F), and Daily Water Intake. Formula library 83 → **88 total**. Example: a 30-year-old male, 70kg / 170cm, with activity factor 1.55 → TDEE 2507 kcal/day, body fat 19.77%.

**v3.5.5 (2026-05-20) +20 formulas / new "Health" group / two latent calculate-engine bugs fixed**: the formula library grows from 63 → **83 cards (+32%)** and gains **Health** as the 6th group (BMI, BMR basal metabolic rate, target heart rate). Math gains 7 (Heron's formula, sector area/arc, arithmetic/geometric series sums, 2D vector length/dot product), Physics gains 5 (centripetal acceleration, spring SHM period, spring PE, Planck E=hf, kinetic friction), Finance gains 2 (effective annual rate EAR, break-even point BEP), Engineering gains 2 (LC resonance, RC cutoff frequency). The PR accidentally surfaced two latent calculate-engine bugs that had been there since launch: (1) the Math.E regex misreplaced the `e` inside scientific-notation literals like `6.626e-34` with `2.718`, breaking Planck / gravity / Coulomb formulas; (2) `toFixed(12)` underflowed tiny numbers like `3.313e-19` to 0. Both fixed together → Planck now shows `3.313e-19`, gravity shows `1.982e+20`.

**v3.5.4 (2026-05-20) unified escape pattern for built-in formula render**: after v3.5.3 closed the custom-formula XSS, the built-in formula render (63 cards) still used the same unsafe `onclick=` string interpolation, kept as known tech debt (no user-injection surface, but would break the day any formula name contained `'`). This release aligns both render paths — `data-*` attributes + `addEventListener` + `escapeFormulaHtml()`. Defense-in-depth, zero functional change. End-to-end verified: circle area r=5 → 78.5398, Pythagoras a=3 b=4 → 5, compound interest P=10000 r=5 n=12 t=10 → 16470.0949.

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

**v3.5.3 (2026-05-20) deep audit + triple fix**: a per-feature browser test of the headline features (function plot / statistics / 3D / formula library / Pro gate) surfaced three pre-existing bugs, fixed in one go:

- **graphModal structure swallows SEO guide + footer** (CRITICAL, broken since site launch): a misplaced closing `</div>` nested `<section id="guide">` and `<footer>` inside the graph modal. While the modal is closed (99% of the time), both vanish under `display:none` — SEO content, AdSense material, copyright and trust signals **never rendered to users**. Fix: relocate the closing tag so they become direct body children.
- **Custom-formula XSS injection** (CRITICAL, CWE-79): `customFormulaItem()` interpolated user-supplied name/expression directly into an inline `onclick="selectFormula('${name}', ...)"` string, enabling arbitrary JS execution that could exfiltrate localStorage (including the Pro JWT) or bypass the Pro gate. Fix: drop inline `onclick=`, switch to `data-*` attributes + `addEventListener` binding + HTML escaping.
- **`y=` / `f(x)=` prefix mistaken for a parameter** (MEDIUM): function plot accepted `y=x^2`, displayed `y = y=x^2`, and spawned a bogus `y` slider (treating `y` as a free parameter). Fix: strip the prefix before evaluation; legitimate `x^2+y^2` (no `=`) still correctly treats `y` as a free parameter.

All 7 Pro gates and 4 free features verified — no false lockouts, no accidental unlocks.

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## What's New in v3.4 🛡️ (Security Hardening & Brand Protection)

v3.4 (2026-05-16) layers multiple protections and hardens the Worker — **without changing the MIT license**:

- **IP / brand protection layer**: added `NOTICE.md` and `TERMS.md` explicitly reserving trademarks (`∑ Calc™`, `∑ Super Calculator™`, `∑ Calc Pro™`, `MoneyAI168™`), the official SaaS service scope, and visual assets. Source code stays MIT — free to fork (forks must rename).
- **Worker KV-based rate limiting** (v2.3.0): dual-layer on `/license/issue` — 10 req/60s per IP, 5 req/3600s per subscriptionId. Cloudflare's Rate Limiting binding was empirically found not to count across requests under Dashboard deployment, so KV fixed-window is used instead (cross-request, arbitrary windows). Graceful degrade on KV failure.
- **`/webhook/paypal` source-IP observation** (log-only): matches PayPal's published CIDRs; non-matching sources are logged but never blocked (PayPal officially discourages hard IP allowlisting; signature verification remains the primary defense).
- **Custom domain**: the Live License Worker is now served via `https://api.moneyai168.com` (`*.workers.dev` kept in parallel, zero downtime).

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## What's New in v3.3 🔐 (Security Architecture)

The v3.3 series (completed in a single day on 2026-05-14, spanning v3.2.0 → v3.3.1) replaces v3.1's pure-frontend license code system with a **server-signed JWT + KV-backed instant revocation** architecture. This closes a critical license-forging vulnerability and introduces a permanent Sandbox/Live dual-mode for future testing.

### Why the upgrade was needed

v3.1 generated Crockford-alphabet codes (`SUPC-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`) using a pure-frontend FNV-1a hash. **There was no actual verification** — anyone who read the JS source could produce valid codes locally and bypass payment. v3.2.1 onwards replaces this with **JWT + Cloudflare Worker + KV-backed subscription state verification**, fully closing that hole.

### Security defense matrix

| Attack vector | Defense | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Forge `subscriptionId` to mint a JWT | ❌ 404 — KV has no such subscription | Real test passed |
| Forge a PayPal webhook (no real cert) | ❌ 401 — `verify-webhook-signature` API rejects | Simulator confirmed |
| Real PayPal webhook (real cert) | ✅ 200 — signature verified | Sandbox e2e verified |
| Reuse old JWT after subscription cancel | ❌ 401 — KV checked on every validate | Sandbox e2e verified |
| Try to re-issue after cancel | ❌ 403 — KV `status !== 'active'` | Endpoint tested |
| Steal `SECRET_KEY` | ❌ Stored as Cloudflare Worker Secret, never in code/KV | Design-level guarantee |

### Instant revocation mechanism (core improvement)

| Stage | Behavior | Time to invalidation |
|---|---|---|
| User cancels subscription | PayPal fires `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED` webhook | T |
| Worker verifies signature + updates KV `status='cancelled'` | T + ~1s |
| User's next operation triggers `/license/validate` | T + ? (depends on activity) |
| Worker reads KV `cancelled` → 401 | **Immediate** |
| Frontend `verifyWithServer` runs every 6 hours | **Within 6 hours at the latest** |

The old architecture (pure JWT, 1-year lifetime) would allow a cancelled user to keep using Pro for the full year. The new architecture **invalidates within 6 hours at worst**, and instantly on next active operation.

### Sandbox dual-mode

Because of a PayPal policy restriction (Taiwan-registered seller accounts cannot receive payment from Taiwan-registered buyer accounts), the seller cannot self-test in Live mode. v3.3 introduces a query-param switch:

| Mode | Entry point | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Live | `https://boboidvtw.github.io/` | Real paying customers |
| Sandbox | `https://boboidvtw.github.io/?sandbox=1` | Test mode, no real charges, **orange warning banner at top** |

Sandbox mode uses an independent PayPal test account, an independent Cloudflare Worker, and an independent KV namespace. `localStorage` keys are suffixed with `_sb` to prevent cross-contamination.

### Module responsibilities

| Module | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `pro-config.js` | 95 | Central config. Detects `?sandbox=1` to switch endpoints, PayPal client-id, plan IDs, storage keys |
| `license-api.js` | 124 | Worker API client. Exposes `issueWithRetry` (retries on both 404 and 403+pending), `validate`, `parsePayload` |
| `pro-manager.js` | 236 | Pro state mgmt. `isProActive` for sync UI check; `verifyWithServer` for background re-validation (6h interval); `refreshTokenIfNeeded` for auto-renew (triggers at <48h remaining) |
| `paypal-integration.js` | 140 | PayPal Subscribe button. `loadPayPalSDK` dynamically loads the SDK (no longer hardcoded client-id); `onApprove` shows retry progress |
| `pro-ui.js` | 320 | Modal, Pro badge, plan toggle, sandbox warning banner, init |

### Deployment checklist

| Item | Location | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare Worker (Live) | `supercalc-license-validator.boboidvtw.workers.dev` | 5 env vars + `LICENSES` KV binding |
| Cloudflare Worker (Sandbox) | `supercalc-license-validator-sandbox.boboidvtw.workers.dev` | Same 5 env vars (sandbox values) + `LICENSES_SANDBOX` KV binding |
| PayPal Live Webhook | PayPal Dashboard | URL → Live Worker, subscribed to 8+ events |
| PayPal Sandbox Webhook | PayPal Sandbox Dashboard | URL → Sandbox Worker |

Worker secrets: `SECRET_KEY` (JWT signing), `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Plaintext variables: `PAYPAL_API_BASE`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`.

### For developers: local testing

You don't need a real PayPal account to test the frontend modules:

```bash
cd boboidvtw.github.io
python3 -m http.server 8765
# Visit http://localhost:8765/?sandbox=1
```

Sandbox mode hits the deployed Sandbox Worker (not a local one). For local Worker development, use `wrangler dev`.

### ⊕ Phase 6 — Equation Solver (Multi-Function Intersections)

Click the "⊕ Intersect" button to automatically find all pairwise intersections of visible functions.

- Algorithm: 800-point scan → sign-change detection → **bisection refinement** (1e-9 precision, max 60 iterations)
- Auto-deduplication of nearby candidate roots
- More robust than Newton-Raphson — guaranteed convergence on sign-change intervals

**Verification example**:
- `x² ∩ (x+6)` → finds exact intersections **(-2, 4)** and **(3, 9)**
- Analytical solution: `x²-x-6=0` → `x∈{-2, 3}` ✓

### 📊 Phase 7 — Statistics Mode

Switch to "📉 Statistics" mode and enter data to plot:

| Chart Type | Output | Use Case |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Histogram** | 12 bins, frequency, `n/mean/σ/min/max` | Univariate distribution |
| **Scatter + Linear Regression** | `y = mx + b`, `R²` | Correlation analysis |
| **Box Plot** | Five-number summary + IQR + outliers | Distribution spread |

**Verification examples**:
- N(5, 2) sample (n=200) → `mean=5.052`, `σ=1.955` (error < 3%)
- Linear regression `y=2x+3+noise` → `y=1.999x+3.136`, **R²=0.9962**
- 50 normal + 2 outliers → correctly identifies `outliers=2`

### 🎲 Phase 8 — 3D Surface Plotting (z = f(x,y))

Switch to "🎲 3D" mode and enter `z = f(x,y)` to render an interactive 3D surface:

- **Custom lightweight 3D engine**: Pure Canvas 2D, no WebGL/Three.js
- **Three render styles**: Surface (filled with heat-map color) / Wireframe / Contour (10-step elevation)
- **HSL heat-map**: Low z → blue (240°), high z → red (0°)
- **Interaction**: Mouse drag rotates, scroll wheel zooms (0.2× ~ 5×)
- **Painter's algorithm**: 32×32 = 1024 faces sorted by average z-depth

**Classic examples**:
- `z = sin(x)*cos(y)` → saddle surface (clear saddle point)
- `z = sin(sqrt(x²+y²))` → concentric ripples
- `z = x²-y²` → hyperbolic paraboloid

### Tech Stack Choices

| Domain | Choice | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Rendering | Canvas 2D | Zero deps, broad compat, easy to control |
| 3D | Custom rotation projection + painter's algorithm | Educational, no WebGL needed |
| Numerical derivative | Central difference | 2nd-order accuracy, simple |
| Numerical integration | Simpson's 1/3 | 4th-order accuracy, fast convergence |
| Root finding | Bisection | Robust, guaranteed convergence |
| Regression | Least squares | Closed-form, no iteration |
| Storage | localStorage | Pure frontend, no server |
| i18n | data-i18n attributes + JSON dictionary | Pure frontend, extensible |

### Numerical Methods Detail

```javascript
// Central difference (Phase 5 tangent)
numericalDerivative(fn, x, params, h=1e-5)
  → (fn(x+h) - fn(x-h)) / (2*h)
  → 2nd-order accuracy O(h²)

// Simpson's 1/3 rule (Phase 5 integral)
numericalIntegral(fn, a, b, params, n=1000)
  → (h/3) * [f(x₀) + 4·Σf(x_odd) + 2·Σf(x_even) + f(xₙ)]
  → 4th-order accuracy O(h⁴)

// Bisection (Phase 6 intersection refinement)
refinePairBisection(fA, fB, lo, hi, params)
  → bisect g(x) = fA(x) - fB(x)
  → converges when |g(mid)| < 1e-9 or (hi-lo)/2 < tol

// 3D projection (Phase 8)
project3D(x, y, z, state, w, h)
  → 1. X-axis rotation (elevation rotX)
  → 2. Y-axis rotation (azimuth rotY)
  → 3. Orthogonal projection (preferred for science viz)
  → 4. Zoom scaling
```

## FAQ

See [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) for the full FAQ.

**Q: Does it require an internet connection?**
A: No. Once `index.html` is downloaded, it runs completely offline. All computation (including 3D rendering) happens locally.

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**
A: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+. 3D mode performs best on hardware from 2018 or later.

**Q: Why Canvas 2D instead of WebGL for 3D?**
A: Education first. Hand-rolled rotation matrices + painter's algorithm let learners fully understand 3D rendering principles, with no WebGL context compatibility issues. 32×32 resolution runs smoothly on most devices.

**Q: How complex can expressions be?**
A: Most JavaScript `Math.*` functions are supported, including nested parentheses. Example: `a*sin(b*x) + cos(c*x²) - sqrt(abs(x))`. We avoid `eval` — all expressions are compiled in isolated scope via `new Function`.

**Q: Is calculation history saved?**
A: Yes, stored in browser `localStorage`. Cleared when browser cache is cleared. No data is uploaded.

**Q: Why bisection instead of Newton-Raphson for intersections?**
A: Bisection **guarantees convergence** on any sign-change interval, avoiding Newton's divergence risk near inflection points. The slower convergence is imperceptible — 1e-9 precision needs only ~30 iterations.

  variables: ["x", "y"],
  category: "geometry",  // geometry | physics | chemistry | finance
  description: "Brief description"
}
```

### Adding a 3D Preset Surface

Edit the `default3DExpr` presets:

```javascript
const presets = [
  { name: "Saddle", expr: "sin(x)*cos(y)" },
  { name: "Ripple", expr: "sin(sqrt(x*x+y*y))" },
  // Add here
  { name: "Gaussian", expr: "exp(-(x*x+y*y))" }
];
```
